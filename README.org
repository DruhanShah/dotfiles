#+title: Personal configurations
#+author: Druhan Shah

This branch is intended to be a hub for my different desktop configurations (Arch linux btw ;)). Each completed theme will be included below with screenshots.


* Notebook

This one aims at replicating a notebook-like feel with a light theme, minimal editor interfaces that are restricted to certain aspect ratios (through the WM layout) and horizontal scrolling-based organization of windows.

* MacOS but Not Reallyâ„¢

This is a work in progress intended to mimic MacOS in its comfortable UI, smooth animations and characteristic design choices.

(No screenshots because WIP)
