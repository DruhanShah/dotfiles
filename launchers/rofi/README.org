#+title: Rofi configuration
#+author: Druhan Shah

This is not a literate config like in the emacs directory, just a description.

This configuration of Rofi attempts to mimic the UI of launchers like Raycast and Alfred while still using standard Rofi scripts.

I have bound a keybind in my WM config that launches a "master-script" which essentially chooses the rofi function to perform. I could have bound them to individual keybinds, but I prefer it this way, YMMV.

This is what the application launcher looks like with the Flexoki theme (floating window in the middle), and the other scripts effectively look the same:
